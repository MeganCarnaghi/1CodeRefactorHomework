# 1CodeRefactorHomework

Objective:
For the Marketing Agency: Create a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

My Edits:
-Added descriptive comments in the HTML and CSS files to denote various sections and make them easier to find.
-Added descriptive title in the head tag of the HTML file.
-Added semantic elements where appropriate in the HTML file (Header, Nav, Footer, Section, Main, Aside, etc.)
-Added alt text to all images in the HTML file.
-Consolidated and cleaned up the CSS file to avoid unecessary duplication of styling and make the file easier to read.
